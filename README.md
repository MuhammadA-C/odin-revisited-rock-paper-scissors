The Odin Project : Foundations : (Revisited) Rock Paper Scissors Project - added a GUI

---

**Overview:** This project is supposed to allow a player to play against the computer in a game of rock, paper, and scissors. 

GUI:
For this version of the project, we had to create a GUI using HTML and CSS. 

Playing The Game: 
In this version, the user no longer has to enter into a prompt box to play the game. 
The user will be able to select cards that each represent rock, paper, or scissors.
