The Odin Project : Foundations : (Revisited) Rock Paper Scissors Project - added a GUI

Overview: This project is supposed to allow a player play against the computer in a game of rock, paper, and scissors. For this verison of the project I created I GUI using HTML and CSS. 

Playing: In this version the play no longer has to enter into a prompt box to play the game. The player will be able to select cards that each represent rock, paper, or scissors.
